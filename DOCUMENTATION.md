# DeftSharp.Windows.Input Documentation

**At this point, all project documentation should be in this file. In the future, we may move it to a more convenient location.**

Please keep your documentation concise and clear. When creating, please pay attention to already existing documentation, e.g. in the [README.md](https://github.com/Empiree/DeftSharp.Windows.Input/blob/main/README.md) file.

Please structure your documentation so that it goes from the most common user cases to the more specific ones.

Any help in creating documentation is welcome!
